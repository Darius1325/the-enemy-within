But it is also a dangerous land, steeped in superstition and fear, where peasants cling to their protective talismans to ward off evil and the ruinous powers of Chaos. Since it was founded by the legendary warrior-king Sigmar, the Empire has withstood invasions, plagues and civil wars, triumphing thanks to the courage of its armies and the tenacity of its people. However, evil haunts the very heart of the country, thriving in the darkness of caves or in ancient fortresses lost in the woods. Greenskins raid the borders of the Empire and the threat of invasion from the Nordic tribes, worshippers of the monstrous Chaos gods, is ever-present."

It is a rich region, well defended by its powerful knighthood. The population is made up of courtly aristocrats and knights, fine ladies and satisfied, respectful peasants.

Because of this, her cult is the largest in the Old World, for all it has a limited presence in the Empire.

But it was all a trick — Ranald had faked it all — and, laughing, the new god gleefully danced into the heavens. While generally portrayed as a dapper Human wearing a perpetual smile, there is little consistency to the height, weight, skin colour, or even gender of Ranald, though the god is more commonly portrayed as male in the Empire.

When older, he received the magical warhammer Ghal-maraz ('Skull-splitter') as a gift from the Dwarf king Kurgan Ironbeard for saving his life from Greenskins. Sigmar later allied with the Dwarfs and their combined forces defeated the Greenskins. He was then crowned as the first emperor of the Human tribes he'd united.

Given their clannish nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts wherever they settle. Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone a mountain. Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a fundamental aspect of their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death. Whilst it might be hard for others to win a Dwarf's friendship, once given it is absolute. While not as ageless as the near-immortal Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries. Indeed, some say that as long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down in battle, such is the strength of their conviction."

Halflings are also a common sight in many of Reikland's villages, where it is not uncommon to find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm. They are communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with the concept of private ownership and space. Halflings are short, apple-cheeked and beardless, resembling big-eyed, round-faced (and round bodied) Human children, and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this impression. They are known for their enormous appetites in all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they're huggers), social boundaries ('Well me' great aunt's just shacked up with me best mate, and you should hear what they've been up to!'), and property rights ('It's not like he's using it!'); this last has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery."

Tall and slender with delicately pointed ears, most Elves have long, fine hair and melodious voices. Although they might look frail, their physiology is not only surprisingly strong, but also extraordinarily agile and dextrous. There are very few noticeable gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion among Humans who interact with them. The High Elves, who call themselves 'Asur', are native to Ulthuan, a magical island lying to the west of the Old World. A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the world's civilisations. High Elves show considerable disdain for Dwarfs, with whom they have a long history of conflict. Since their abandonment of the Old World in the aftermath of the War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the 'kinstrife', although this isn't something they discuss openly with outsiders. As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical, and ruthless."

During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then ensued, leaving 'Wood Elves' culturally very different to their High Elf cousins. There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen in Reikland. The 'Asrai' from Athel Loren across the Grey Mountains, and 'Eonir' of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north in Nordland."

The rarer ones billow like a cloud in the upper atmosphere, while darker, denser varieties run across the ground, or saturate the earth itself. The eight Colleges of Magic (Luminous, Golden, Jade, Celestial, Grey, Amethyst, Blazing and Amber) are identified by their colour and a specific rune. A Sorcerer belonging to one of these eight Colleges can be recognised by the name of that College, and he or she also wears robes in the colours of that College, so, for example, a Sorcerer could be a Luminous Sorcerer or a Golden Sorcerer."

Since gaining a charter affording it the right to self-rule in 1066IC from Boris Goldgather, Kemberbad has been a Freistadt led by a local council."

Originally, the Counts were warlords subject to Sigmar, and each controlled a vast province of the Empire. Over time, the various provinces prospered or declined, so that today the Empire comprises ten Elector Counts - although there were once twelve - each ruling over a vast region. Within the borders of their provinces, the Electors can generally act as they wish, although the Emperor retains a right of supervision. The title of Count is hereditary, and the noble families from which they come have a long and glorious history. The Emperor is chosen from among the Electors.

Indeed, so massive is the river that almost half the fresh water of the Old World flows down its length, for it not only drains all the Reikland with its many tributaries, but most of the Empire beyond. By the time the Reik flows into the Reikland, it is already so wide it frequently appears more lake than river, leaving it impossible to bridge using standard engineering methods. As this immense watercourse approaches Altdorf to meet the dark waters of the Talabec, both rivers split into a complex network of channels that spread outwards to form the foggy Altdorf Flats. Many of the thinner distributaries caused by this are bridgeable, ensuring Altdorf is a natural centre for trade as it is the only place where the Reik can be crossed on foot for many hundreds of miles. This single fact has secured Altdorf's dominance of the area, both militarily and fiscally."
