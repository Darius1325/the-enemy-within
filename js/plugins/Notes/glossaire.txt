Reikland : 
Standing proud in the heart of the Old World, the Reikland is the richest and most powerful of the Empire's grand provinces. Known for its engineers, wizards, and merchants, and for being the birthplace of the Cult of Sigmar, it is a realm of soaring mountains, snaking rivers, dark forests, and powerful trading centres. From his throne in the city of high-spired Altdorf, Emperor Karl-Franz I rules not only the Reikland, but all the Empire that lies beyond.
"Truly, to be born a Reiklander is to be born blessed by the Gods Themselves. Give thanks to Sigmar and be praised." Holy Mother Halma Habermann of Sigmar in 2510 IC.

Empire :
It is the most powerful nation in the Old World, stretching from the borders of Bretonnia in the south-west to the inhospitable plains of Kislev in the north-east. The Empire is home to vast forests, immense mountains and prosperous, cosmopolitan cities, places of learning and culture, where the arts of war and science go hand in hand. But it is also a dangerous land, steeped in superstition and fear, where peasants cling to their protective talismans to ward off evil and the ruinous powers of Chaos. Since it was founded by the legendary warrior-king Sigmar, the Empire has withstood invasions, plagues and civil wars, triumphing thanks to the courage of its armies and the tenacity of its people. However, evil haunts the very heart of the country, thriving in the darkness of caves or in ancient fortresses lost in the woods. Greenskins raid the borders of the Empire and the threat of invasion from the Nordic tribes, worshippers of the monstrous Chaos gods, is ever-present.
"Men of Sigmar ! I see in your eyes the fear of the enemy. I see in your eyes that you do not know how to fight these monsters. Men of the Empire, I have the answers to your questions. We will fight them with iron, we will fight them with courage, but above all, we will fight them with our faith in Sigmar !" Magnus the Pious, before the Battle of the Kislev's Doors.

Bretonnia :
People travelling through Bretonnia discover a land of fertile farms, rolling hills, breathtakingly beautiful mountains and unreal forests. Unlike the Empire, Bretonnia has a temperate climate and the land is more easily farmed. Its immense forests and wilderness are separated by fertile plains and valleys where the Bretonnian nobility have established their feudal estates. It is a rich region, well defended by its powerful knighthood. The population is made up of courtly aristocrats and knights, fine ladies and satisfied, respectful peasants. Bretonnian chefs are renowned for their culinary skills and the country's wines are renowned throughout the Old World. This is the image that Bretonnians seek to project of their nation, and it is not entirely misleading.
"With our spears and our swords, we will strike down our cowardly enemies. We, the proud Knights of Bretonnia, will keep them at bay. As long as we have faith in the Lady, their weapons will not harm us. Our glory will never fade, for our deeds will live on. For the King, Bretonnia and the Lady, charge ! Hail the enemy !" Duke Bohémond, the Scourge of Beasts, at the Battle of the ford of Grismar.

Kislev :
These lands, with their harsh, icy climate, are inhabited by hardy, hardy people, accustomed to life on the immense steppes that stretch on forever, with no relief whatsoever. Surrounded by the Sea of Claws to the west, the Land of the Trolls to the north and the Mountains of the Edge of the World to the east, its inhabitants struggle to survive, constantly under attack from raiders descending from Norsca, from the tribes of Greenskins hiding in the mountains and from the bands of nomadic marauders who infest the steppe itself. The lands of Kislev are the bulwark that protects the Empire from invasions from the north, and the two nations have fought side by side many times over the centuries to defend their territories from the infamous followers of Chaos.
"The strength of Kislev lies in each and every one of you. The land has summoned you all here and it is here that you will put that strength to the test by standing up to Chaos. There is great power in this land and tomorrow it will run through your veins. Use it wisely." Tsarina Katarina, Ice Queen of Kislev.

Manann :
Volatile Manann, the son of Taal and Rhya, is the capricious King of the Sea, Master of the Maelstroms, and Summoner of Storms. Known for his black moods and erratic temper, folk claim his cult is needed more than any other, for if ever there is a god that must be appeased, it's Manaan. He's depicted as an enormous, blackbearded man with seaweed in his hair and a great, five-pointed crown of black iron upon his troubled brow. He's said to dwell at the bottom of the ocean, the rise and fall of his massive chest forming the waves and tides as the greatest monsters of the deep gather in his court.
"As far as I know, the Lord of the Tide is as ticklish as an Averheim damsel. You have to court him, offer him presents and speak to him very softly. But the slightest false move and you're in for a lifetime of suffering. Yeah boy!" Amos The Black, pirate.

Morr :
Urbane Morr, God of Death and King of the Underworld, is husband to Verena, brother to murderous Khaine, and father of Myrmidia and Shallya. He sends divine ravens to guide dead souls to the Portal, the pillared gateway between the mortal realms and the realm of the gods. He then leads each soul from there to its final resting place: either Morr's Underworld, or the afterlife of another god. He is commonly portrayed as a tall, darkhaired man of aristocratic bearing, with a brooding, intense air.
"Father's resting in the Morr estate now. And we've taken up a general collection to pay the Priests to make sure the old bastard stays there." Ludmilla von Thieldorf, Reikland aristocrat.

Myrmidia :
In the Empire, bronzed Myrmidia, daughter of Verena and Morr, sister of Shallya, is the Goddess of Strategy and Scientific Warfare. However, in the sun-drenched south, Myrmidia is much more than this: she acts as the patron deity of both the Estalian Kingdoms and the Tilean City States, and is fanatically worshipped in both realms. Because of this, her cult is the largest in the Old World, for all it has a limited presence in the Empire. She is commonly portrayed as a tall, muscular, young woman armed and equipped in archaic, southern stylings. She is known for her calm, honourable approach to all matters, and her clerics do what they can to emulate this.
"I served alongside mercenaries from Tilea. They were all amazing warriors, but they spent far too much time with their noses in their Myrmidia bibles. I'd never seen anything like it. These guys planned everything down to the last detail. They had ready-made tactics to deal with any situation on the battlefield. They even had diagrams for digging their latrines! Unfortunately, all their preparations came to nothing when the demons attacked us, but at least they got away in an orderly and disciplined fashion !" Lewis Heigermann, mercenary.

Ranald :
According to myth, Ranald was once mortal, a gentle bandit who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. This so charmed Shallya that the goddess fell in love. One fateful day, she found Ranald dying, fatally touched by the plagues of the Fly Lord. Unable to accept this, she let Ranald drink from her holy chalice, granting the rogue eternal life. But it was all a trick — Ranald had faked it all — and, laughing, the new god gleefully danced into the heavens. While generally portrayed as a dapper Human wearing a perpetual smile, there is little consistency to the height, weight, skin colour, or even gender of Ranald, though the god is more commonly portrayed as male in the Empire. More a cheerful trickster than outright criminal, Ranald is said to have a love of deflating pride with clever tricks and ruses.
"Everyone knows that those great lords who call Ranald a thief, an agitator and a liar when everyone hears them are going to pray to him in secret when the storm breaks." Otto Potbelly, Stirlander farmer.

Rhya :
Bountiful Rhya is the Goddess of Fertility and Summer, widely known as the Earth Mother and She Who Sustains Life. Though typically depicted as the wife of Taal, myths connect her to many gods, and she has children from many of those relationships. Most commonly portrayed as a tall, beautiful women wreathed in leaves and bedecked in fruit, Rhya's statues are normally nude, pregnant, and surrounded by her children. Many theologians tie Rhya to the Old Faith, a prehistoric cult comprised of ancient farmers and hunters who wrested a living from the land before the Empire was born, and one still found in secluded communities to this day.
"Of course I pay homage to Taal and Rhya, but as I see fit. It seems that some of their followers live in the woods like animals, dressed in animal skins. We're humans, not beasts... Someone needs to remind them of that." Siegfried Kant, Marienburg bourgeois.

Shallya :
Shallya is the Goddess of Healing, Mercy, and Compassion. She is the daughter of Verena and Morr, and the sister of Myrmidia. Shallya is normally portrayed as a young, beautiful maiden whose eyes are perpetually welling with tears as she weeps for the world's pain. It is said Shallya's compassion knows no bounds, and in some myths — such as the stories of Ranald tricking her into granting him immortality, or Manaan trapping her at the bottom of the sea — she seems trusting to the point of foolishness. However, her cultists maintain her mercy is available to all, without judgment. True foolishness consists of presuming to judge who is worthy of Shallya's grace and who is not.
"Don't go upsetting the Shallyans. Oh, of course she won't do anything to you, she's the Merciful Heart, but you don't want to alienate her parents." Adeline Burgerkampf, brigand chieftain.

Sigmar :
Sigmar is the Empire's patron, and his cult dominates the realm. Because Sigmar was once the emperor, his worship is inextricably interwoven with politics, and three of the cult's highest-ranking members are directly involved with electing new emperors. According to legend, 2,500 years ago Sigmar's birth was heralded by a twin-tailed comet, and he was born the first son of the chief of the Unberogen tribe. When older, he received the magical warhammer Ghal-maraz (‘Skull-splitter') as a gift from the Dwarf king Kurgan Ironbeard for saving his life from Greenskins. Sigmar later allied with the Dwarfs and their combined forces defeated the Greenskins. He was then crowned as the first emperor of the Human tribes he'd united. After fifty years of extraordinary rule, Sigmar mysteriously vanished, only to later ascend to divinity, crowned as a god by Ulric, Sigmar's patron in life.
"Sigmar protects us all equally, but some, like the Electors Counts and nobles, are more equal than others." Heinrich, Warrior-priest of Sigmar.

Taal :
Taal is the God of Wild Places and Animals, and the King of Nature. He is the husband to Rhya, and father to Manaan, and is perceived by Taalites to be the king of the gods, though other cults dispute this. All nature is under his purview, from the snaking rivers to the tallest mountains, from the smallest insect to the greatest beast. He is normally portrayed as a powerfully built, virile man with long, wild hair and great spreading antlers, and is known for his volatile moods and his need to hunt.
"With all due respect to the followers of Taal, the next time I come across one who prevents me from hunting deer in the Sacred Grove, I'm going to put my arrow through his hide !" Ralt from Nuln, farmer.

Ulric :
Ulric is the ferocious God of Wolves, Winter, and Warfare. He is the brother of Taal and, according to Ulrican lore, the king of the gods, although other cults dispute this. He is normally portrayed as a massive, heavily bearded barbarian wearing a white wolfpelt cloak, and bearing a mighty war-axe named Blitzbeil. He's a distant, harsh, and unforgiving god who expects his cultists to rely on individual strength and prowess. He despises weakness, cowardice, and trickery, and favours the direct approach in all matters.
"My friends, let me explain what I mean by this: Sigmar was an Ulrican. Sigmar founded this Empire. Therefore, the Empire is Ulric's nation. We are all Ulricans! This slavish devotion to Sigmar must stop !" Johann von Schattenlas, politician from Carroburg.

Verena :
Wise Verena, the Goddess of Learning and Justice, is the wife of dark Morr and the mother of Myrmidia and Shallya. She is generally depicted as a tall, classically beautiful woman, and usually carries a sword and a set of scales. As the patron of justice she is concerned with fairness rather than the letter of the law: she opposes tyranny and oppression as much as crime.
"All this may be true, but no man or woman, not even Dame Verena, can pronounce a sentence before the opposing party has presented its arguments. Then, once both claimants have spoken, the judgement will be handed down." Judge Wilhelm Manfred.

Humans :
Humans are the most numerous and widespread of the civilised species of the Old World. From the plains of the Estalian Kingdoms to the frozen oblasts of Imperial Kislev, Humans occupy every corner of the continent, and they thrive. The largest, most powerful Human realm is the Empire, a patchwork of powerful provinces blanketed in seemingly endless forests. Standing proud at the heart of this Empire, the Reikland is its richest, most cosmopolitan region.
"They are corrupt, jealous, and rapacious in their short-lived hungers. But, when mindful of their petty needs and their fear of what we represent, they are easily shaped." Imryth Emberfell, Ambassador from Caledor.

Dwarfs :
Dwarfs — or 'Dawi' as they call themselves — are legendarily gruff and stubborn. While the majority reside in vast mountainside fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of the Reikland also have Dwarf populations. Given their clannish nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts wherever they settle. Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone a mountain. Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a fundamental aspect of their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death. Whilst it might be hard for others to win a Dwarf's friendship, once given it is absolute. While not as ageless as the near-immortal Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries. Indeed, some say that as long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down in battle, such is the strength of their conviction.
"My aunt Bessi was the greediest, as were six of her sons. But Bessi has nothing on them Dwarfs. Eyes grow as big as Mannslieb at even a scratch of gold. But, if you tell them that, they'll growl at you like you've taken the last honeycake, and start scribbling notes in one of their damned books about insulting their family honour or whatnot." 'Lilly' Joseppinalina Hayfoot, Pedlar in the Reikland.

Halflings :
Halflings are ubiquitous across the Reikland, found working in service industries in all towns, with an entire district of Reikland's capital of Altdorf, known as Haffenstadt, packed tight with hundreds of extended Halfling families supporting restaurants, taverns, pipeweed stores, and an enormous number of street-food hawkers. Halflings are also a common sight in many of Reikland's villages, where it is not uncommon to find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm. They are communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with the concept of private ownership and space. Halflings are short, apple-cheeked and beardless, resembling big-eyed, round-faced (and round bodied) Human children, and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this impression. They are known for their enormous appetites in all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they're huggers), social boundaries (‘Well me' great aunt's just shacked up with me best mate, and you should hear what they've been up to!'), and property rights (‘It's not like he's using it!'); this last has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery.
"If I gets meself the sort wot eats and smokes all day, then I’m happy as Ranald in catnip. It’s when I get them without proper manners nicking me crockery or knives and forks: that I just can’t abide! They’re all smiles and shrugs when the watch come to pick ’em up, like they don’t understand what they done wrong." Stefan Krause, Innkeeper from Stirgau.

High Elves :
High Elves are a relatively common sight on the rivers of Reikland. Both Altdorf and Nuln boast sizeable districts populated by High Elf merchants who ship goods down the Reik through Marienburg to the sea. These merchants are by far the most numerous of the High Elves found in Reikland, alongside diplomatic entourages and support staff. Aloof, alien, and long-lived, they are a passionate, emotional folk widely perceived in the Reikland to be the most beautiful of the species, and also the most arrogant. Tall and slender with delicately pointed ears, most Elves have long, fine hair and melodious voices. Although they might look frail, their physiology is not only surprisingly strong, but also extraordinarily agile and dextrous. There are very few noticeable gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion among Humans who interact with them. The High Elves, who call themselves ‘Asur’, are native to Ulthuan, a magical island lying to the west of the Old World. A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the world’s civilisations. High Elves show considerable disdain for Dwarfs, with whom they have a long history of conflict. Since their abandonment of the Old World in the aftermath of the War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the ‘kinstrife’, although this isn’t something they discuss openly with outsiders. As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical, and ruthless.
"Don’t talk to me about those bloody bastards! Alrug Skycaster, my ultimate granduncle, was bloody betrayed in the bloody War of bloody Vengeance by those… those… ARGH! It’s our clan’s oldest grudge! Stood for thousands of bloody years! When I find the descendants of bloody Galanthiel Whisperthorn, by Grungni! I’m going to teach them all — every single last one of them — a lesson in manners with my axe !" Snorrt Leivvusson, Diplomat from Karak Ziflin.

Wood Elves :
Wood Elves are a rare sight in the Reikland, and for good reason. During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then ensued, leaving ‘Wood Elves’ culturally very different to their High Elf cousins. There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen in Reikland. The ‘Asrai’ from Athel Loren across the Grey Mountains, and ‘Eonir’ of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north in Nordland.
"Elves living in the woods? Don’t be bloody ridiculous. Elves live in white towers and pretty boats over in Altdorf-town, you idiot." ‘Jammy’ Mercimaus Alderflower II, Scholar from Fielbach.

Altdorf :
Emperor Karl-Franz I holds court in Altdorf, the capital of the Reikland and the Empire as a whole. It stands proudly at the confluence of the mighty Reik and Talabec rivers, as well as at the end of many major trade routes, and is easily the wealthiest city in the Empire. This ensures it is always expanding and renewing, with fresh, wide-eyed hopefuls arriving daily, and more commissions for new bridges, buildings, and engineering marvels presented weekly to the city’s burgomeisters than most cities consider in a year.
"Just look at this palace! Such opulence makes me sick. The whole world is on fire and Karl Franz is hiding behind these stone and marble walls. The end of time is nigh !" Nolan Eberhardt, flagellant.

Nuln :
Once the capital, the technological centre of the Empire's military power and the heart of humanity's intellectual influence, Nuln is often described as ‘a crown glittering with the brilliance of its hundred jewels’. Although Altdorf, 145 leagues away outnumbered Nuln in terms of population, it remained the leading city in the arts and social life. However, like the rest of the Empire, Nuln has its secrets, its vulnerabilities and its shadows, and it does its best to confine them to its sprawling network of sewers and the heart of its poorest districts.
"Nuln is the most glittering jewel in the crown of our great Empire. She represents what our civilisation could become..." Herr Borgen von Hauger.

Ubersreik :
The town of Ubersreik is situated near Grey Lady Pass, one of only two major passes over the Grey Mountains into Bretonnia. Because of this, the town regularly sees traders and travellers from across the Old World. The mighty fortress known as the Black Rock is connected to the walls of the town should any less welcome travellers attempt ingress.

Karl Franz I :
The current Emperor is Karl Franz (full name Karl-Franz Holswig Schliestein), Prince of Altdorf and Count Elector of the Reikland. He was elected Emperor in 2502 in all the vigour of his youth, when the Empire was enjoying a period of relative peace and stability. However, the new sovereign knew that this situation would not last and that he would need all his talents as a general and statesman to protect his people and his domains.
"If we die, it will be brandishing our swords, for there is no better death for a warrior. We will sit at Sigmar's banquet like the heroes of old, and our names will be remembered in the songs of our people until the end of time !" Karl Franz's speech to his men.

Colleges of Magic :
There are eight Colleges of Magic, all located in Altdorf, which are the most important schools of Magic in the Old World, where even the Sorcerers of Kislev and Bretonnia go. Each teaches its own type of magic, linked to a specific magical current. Some energies are denser than others. The rarer ones billow like a cloud in the upper atmosphere, while darker, denser varieties run across the ground, or saturate the earth itself. The eight Colleges of Magic (Luminous, Golden, Jade, Celestial, Grey, Amethyst, Blazing and Amber) are identified by their colour and a specific rune. A Sorcerer belonging to one of these eight Colleges can be recognised by the name of that College, and he or she also wears robes in the colours of that College, so, for example, a Sorcerer could be a Luminous Sorcerer or a Golden Sorcerer.
"When I see a human clumsily trying to master the Winds of Magic, I always feel like I'm watching a young child playing with an incredibly powerful weapon. They are far too impatient and limited to acquire the discipline needed to control the Winds of Magic, let alone the art of combining them. This is why the great Teclis decreed that humans should divide their studies into different Colleges, one for each element." Galgarast, Archmage of the White Tower of Hœth.

Kemperbad :
An ancient town with a long and convoluted history, the Grand Freistadt of Kemperbad is known and celebrated for producing the finest brandy in the Reikland. Though part of the Reikland, Kemperbad lies on the eastern bank of the Reik; historically the town has been fought over, and ruled by, nobles from Talabecland, Stirland, and the Reikland, changing hands time and again through a series of marriages, treaties, and wars. Since gaining a charter affording it the right to self-rule in 1066IC from Boris Goldgather, Kemberbad has been a Freistadt led by a local council.

Elector Counts :
The Elector Counts are the rulers of the Empire's major provinces, and it is they who order the raising of the imperial armies. In theory, they are the Emperor's loyal advisors and work to ensure that justice and peace are maintained in their territories. Originally, the Counts were warlords subject to Sigmar, and each controlled a vast province of the Empire. Over time, the various provinces prospered or declined, so that today the Empire comprises ten Elector Counts - although there were once twelve - each ruling over a vast region. Within the borders of their provinces, the Electors can generally act as they wish, although the Emperor retains a right of supervision. The title of Count is hereditary, and the noble families from which they come have a long and glorious history. The Emperor is chosen from among the Electors. Karl Franz, the current Emperor, is also Prince of Altdorf and Count Elector of the Reikland.
"On this day, Count Elector Theoric Gausser, Grand Baron of Nordland, Prince of Salzenmund, Lord of Laurelorn, Duke of Marienburg and Terror of the Nordics, stopped off at this inn to spend the night and described his accommodation as ‘suitable’." Plaque on the wall of the Grimmenhagen guest house.

Reik :
The Reik carries more traffic and trade than all the other rivers in the Old World combined. Indeed, so massive is the river that almost half the fresh water of the Old World flows down its length, for it not only drains all the Reikland with its many tributaries, but most of the Empire beyond. By the time the Reik flows into the Reikland, it is already so wide it frequently appears more lake than river, leaving it impossible to bridge using standard engineering methods. As this immense watercourse approaches Altdorf to meet the dark waters of the Talabec, both rivers split into a complex network of channels that spread outwards to form the foggy Altdorf Flats. Many of the thinner distributaries caused by this are bridgeable, ensuring Altdorf is a natural centre for trade as it is the only place where the Reik can be crossed on foot for many hundreds of miles. This single fact has secured Altdorf’s dominance of the area, both militarily and fiscally.
"At Reikdorf Sigmar the Great stopped off, It was here, on the banks of the mighty Reik that he would found the Empire, his majestic kingdom For here were heroes and gentlemen ready to build a masterpiece that would defy time." Sighardt Schneider-Koller, extract from Sigmar Emperor ! 1797 IC.
